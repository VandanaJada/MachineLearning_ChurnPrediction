# MachineLearning_ChurnPrediction
When customers leave a company, this is often referred to as 'churn'. Churn is a big concern for many service-oriented businesses as there is a  cost of acquiring new customers, so keeping existing customers is important to keep costs down.  Let's look into predicting whether a customer will churn for a telecommunications company.

In this repository, we have performed the end to end Exploratory Data Analysis, and idenfitied the characteristics of the customers that are more likely to churn, and I have used them wisely to create a model, and lately, have deployed the model.

## CONCLUSION
These are some of the quick insights from this exercise:

Electronic check medium are the highest churners
Contract Type - Monthly customers are more likely to churn because of no contract terms, as they are free to go customers.
