# Machine Learning Churn Prediction: Identifying Customer Churn in a Telecommunications Company

In this repository, we have performed an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify characteristics of customers that are more likely to churn in a telecommunications company. We have used these insights to create a machine learning model, and finally, deployed the model.

## Conclusion from EDA
Here are some quick insights from our EDA:

- Customers who use electronic check as their payment medium are the highest churners.
- Monthly contract customers are more likely to churn due to no contract terms, as they have more flexibility to switch.
- Customers with no online security and no tech support are high churners.
- Non-senior citizens are more likely to churn.

## Machine Learning Model
We have used a Random Forest Classifier as our machine learning model to predict customer churn. The model achieved an accuracy of 94% on our dataset.
